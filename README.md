# Lunar.sh

Lunar.sh is a dynamic and visually-rich web dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the moon. It leverages real-time data to present information about the moon's phase, position, and timing, all wrapped in a sleek, space-themed interface that changes based on NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.

## ‚ú® Features

  - **Dynamic Theming**: The dashboard's color scheme dynamically adapts to the daily NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) for a unique visual experience every day.
  - **Positional Awareness**: See the moon's current altitude, azimuth, and visibility from your location.
  - **Key Timings**: Displays local times for moonrise, moonset, and solar noon.
  - **Upcoming Phases**: A grid view of the next four major moon phases and their dates.
  - **Location-Aware**: Automatically detects the user's location to provide accurate data, with a manual override option to search for any city.
  - **Interactive UI**:
      - A visual representation of the moon's current phase.
      - A progress bar showing the moon's position in its orbit between perigee and apogee.
      - User controls for toggling the background blur and switching between 12/24 hour time formats.
  - **Astronomy Picture of the Day**: View information and the story behind the stunning background images provided by NASA.
